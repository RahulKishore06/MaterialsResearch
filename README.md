High-Throughput Band Structure Classification Tool - In Progress

A Python-based pipeline for automated classification and analysis of electronic band structures using Materials Project data. This tool identifies key features such as parallel bands near the Fermi level, flat bands, and band gaps across large datasets, enabling rapid screening of materials with desired electronic properties. It integrates pymatgen, mp-api, and matplotlib for data retrieval, processing, and visualization, and is optimized for high-throughput computational materials research.
